# Simon-Chroma | Interactive Simon Says Game

A modern, high-fidelity reimagining of the classic "Simon Says" memory game. Built with pure Vanilla JavaScript, this project focuses on asynchronous logic, state management, and polished UI/UX principles.


## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3 (Modern Flexbox/Grid, Neumorphism)
* **Logic:** Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)
* **Audio:** Web Audio API implementation for interactive feedback

## 🧠 Key Learning Objectives & Challenges

### 1. State Management
One of the primary challenges was synchronizing the `gameSeq` (generated by the computer) with the `userSeq` (input by the player). I implemented a custom validation logic that checks the user's input at every step to ensure immediate feedback.

### 2. UI/UX & Sensory Feedback
To move beyond a basic logic exercise, I integrated:
* **Asynchronous Timing:** Using `setTimeout` to manage sequence flashes and user input windows.
* **Audio-Visual Sync:** Ensuring that each color flash is perfectly timed with a specific audio frequency to assist user memory.
* **Responsive Design:** Using media queries to ensure the game is fully playable on mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.

### 3. Clean Code Principles
* **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself):** Created modular functions for flashing and sound triggers to keep the codebase maintainable.
* **Semantic HTML:** Focused on accessibility and structured document flow.

## 🎮 Features
* **Progressive Difficulty:** Levels increase in complexity as the sequence grows.
* **Tactile Design:** 3D-styled buttons with active-state animations.
* **Error Handling:** Instant visual and audio feedback on "Game Over."
* **Auto-Reset:** A seamless loop to restart the game without page refreshes.
